Remote fencing scoring light display receiver

This is the receiver portion of the [remote fencing scoring light display](https://github.com/davidsmakerworks/fencing-score-xmit) project. This is designed to be placed on the wall at the ends of the fencing strip. It includes a timer to automatically turn off the lights if no shutoff signal is received from the transmitter within a reasonable amount of time.
